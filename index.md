## About Me

Hello there! My name is Mike Zhang. I'm a Postdoc in NLP at Aalborg University (AAU, Copenhagen campus) advised by Prof. <a href="https://bjerva.github.io/"><u>Johannes Bjerva</u></a> and Prof. <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/153280"><u>Euan Lindsay</u></a>. My research is currently at the intersection of NLP and Education.

Previously, I was a PhD Student in NLP at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU)
advised by Prof. <a href="http://bplank.github.io"><u>Barbara Plank</u></a> and Prof. <a href="http://robvanderg.github.io"><u>Rob van der Goot</u></a>. I was part of
<a href="http://nlpnorth.github.io"><u>NLPnorth</u></a> at ITU and <a href="https://mainlp.github.io"><u>MaiNLP</u></a> at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). I worked on Computational Job Market Analysis (or NLP for HR), where we investigated how to extract information (e.g., skills) from job ads data and match these to existing resources (e.g., taxonomies).

I was fortunate to have conducted a couple of (successful) Ph.D. research visits to (1) the National University of Singapore (NUS) hosted by Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/"><u>Min-Yen Kan</u></a> in Spring 2023 and (2) the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) hosted by Prof. <a href="https://atcbosselut.github.io/"><u>Antoine Bosselut</u></a> in Winter 2024. 

I am interested in:
  - **NLP for Education**: Can we improve students' learning by giving them automatic feedback from NLP tools (e.g., language models)? How can we do this over time?
  - **NLP for HR**: How can we extract relevant skills from job ads and in what way can we match them with existing taxonomies to assist job centers matching candidates to jobs better?
  - **Expertise**: My knowledge is mostly on resource creation, developing annotation guidelines for data annotation, (multilingual) datasets creation in general and specific domains, and language model training on small and large scale.
